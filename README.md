1) Install requirements like this:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2) Then download the windows build for ffmpeg by gyan.dev here:
    https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

3) Choose ffmpeg-release-full.7z and then extract it, then, add the bin folder to your system environment variables.

4) Run the TRexVision script to get your video.

I got the TRexVision from:
https://github.com/ElJuanDeag/TRexVision
But it wasn't intuitive and didn't let you download a video either.
